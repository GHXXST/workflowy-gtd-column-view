# workflowy-gtd-column-view
A GTD-style homepage for viewing multiple Workflowy nodes in one place.

I wanted a way to view multiple instances of Workflowy in one window so I could have an overview of my GTD method, including ongoing projects. Whilst this solution generally works, it does not allow for dragging/dropping between columns â€“ however, you can easily copy/paste text or entire nodes.

*NOTE: I am an absolute novice at coding outside of making small adjustments in WYSIWYG HTML interfaces (ie. Squarespace). But this simple solution works well for me. I use this as my homepage and keep it open in a tab at all times so I can quickly and easily add/view ideas, tasks and projects. Maybe this might be useful for others in creating something more robust.*

#### workflowy-gtd-column-view-standalone.html
This is the standalone HTML version. I add a bookmark to this local file in Chrome. One could also set this as their default new tab.

#### workflowy-gtd-column-view.user.js
This is the UserScript version for Tampermonkey, Greasy Fork, etc.
